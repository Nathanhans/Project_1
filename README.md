Project Summary

Census data allows us to visualize the relationships between many key metrics in the United States.  Two of those metrics are did-not-work rates and poverty rates.  Census data allows us to capture these metrics with the additional granularity of male & female.  We would like to test whether there is a significant relationship between male & female did-not-work disparity (i.e. female did not work rates - male did not work rate) and poverty rates across the US, for the population aged 16-65.

Null Hypothesis:
There is no statistically significant relationship between did-not-work disparity (female vs. male) and poverty rates within the United States

Alternative Hypothesis:
We reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between did-not-work disparity (female vs. male) and poverty rates within the United States
